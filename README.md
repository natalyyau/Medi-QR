# Medi-QR

# Goal:
- User Input from frontend and click submit

- Submit button calls to backend API and sends user input

- Backend processes responses and create risk assessment results and returns the results to the frontend

To run frontend: 
- cd to jsx directory and run "npm run dev" in terminal

To run backend:
- cd to server.js directory and run "node server.js" in terminal

You can run both at the same, by opening two split terminals and following instructions above.


Suggestions:
- We could perhaps use healthcare datasets for risk factors.
