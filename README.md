# Medi-QR

# Important
Note that submit button only works if you are running both the backend and the frontend.
I think you will have to run the frontend first, and then backend.
Make sure you're in the correct directory for it to work, by following the instructions below

To find specific directories, open Medi-OR folder and navigate to App.jsx
- Right click and select properties and copy the location.
- run this into your terminal: cd <location>

To run frontend: 
- cd to jsx directory and run "npm run dev" in terminal

To run backend:
- cd to server.js directory and run "node server.js" in terminal

You can run both at the same, by opening two split terminals and following instructions above.

# Goal:
- User Input from frontend and click submit

- Submit button calls to backend API and sends user input

- Backend processes responses and create risk assessment results and returns the results to the frontend




Suggestions:
- We could perhaps use healthcare datasets for risk factors.
